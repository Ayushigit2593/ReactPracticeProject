# Ayushi's Ideas

## What is this project about?

This project that will help people who like to learn more about a city before travelling there. It will help them to find the below things about any city:

- sights
- restaurants
- festivals
- places to meet local people
- cultural hot spots
- historical hot spots
- upcoming events happening in that city

## How to implement it

It should be a React Webapp (SPA) with a lot of pictures, and a lot of "guided reading" and articles.

What is "guided reading"? It's something like a wiki. We get the first piece of information,
with a few images, a little introduction and a few links about what we could do / visit next if we are at this place in real life.

We will use database to get the data related to cities and can also store user's plan / iternary for visiting that city in the database.

For that we write Features and we create wireframes.

## Who owns the project?

Simple Answer: Ayushi and Perrin (Matthias). We have all the rights, we share all the rights. We have all the freedom and we have all the responsibility.

## What people are we trying to address with this project?

Travellers, people who find other cultures exciting and inspiring, people who like to know about other places and cities, their people and their stories.

## What value has this project?

- **For the developers:** We want to learn how to do a medium to bigger sized React project. Which means:
  - Planning
  - Preparing
  - Working with a database and an API (i.e. a RESTful API at the beginning)
  - Building a professional component tree
  - Working out professional state management.
  - Utilizing all the important concept of the course in the project for better learning and practice.
  
  We want to learn all this and we want to have the biggest fun possible doing it.

- **For the users:** Our project wants to make travellers and interested people even more excited about the places they don't want to miss out in their life.
