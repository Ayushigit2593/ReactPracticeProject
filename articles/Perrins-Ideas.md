# Perrin's Ideas

## What is this project about?

This project is about travelling. Whenever we travel to a foreign city for instance, we'd
like to know important and exciting things about it.

This project helps finding them:

- sights
- restaurants
- festivals
- places to meet local people
- cultural hot spots
- historical hot spots

When I am using the app, it makes a little plan for me: What I could do on day 1, on day 2 etc. according to some information i gave about my interests.

## How to implement it

It should be a React Webapp (SPA) with a lot of pictures, and a lot of "guided reading".

What is "guided reading"? It's something like a wiki. We get the first piece of information,
with a few images, a little introduction and a few links about what we could do / visit next if we are at this place in real life.

Let's say we are located at Trafalgar Square in London. Our database knows that the Royal Albert Hall is just 10 mins walking from Trafalgar Sqare. So our App gives us a link to the "info page" for the Royal Albert Hall.

For this we need a database where we keep track of all the interesting data.

Of course, at the beginning, this database will have only few entries. But it's here for
learning and practicing. So 5 cities with 10 entries each will do very fine for the beginning.

For that we write Features and we create wireframes.

## Who owns the project?

Simple Answer: Ayushi and Perrin (Matthias). We have all the rights, we share all the rights. We have all the freedom and we have all the responsibility.

## What people are we trying to address with this project?

Travellers, people who find other cultures exciting and inspiring, people who like to know about other places and cities, their people and their stories.

## What value has this project?

- **For the developers:** We want to learn how to do a medium to bigger sized React project. Which means:
  - Planning
  - Preparing
  - Working with a database and an API (i.e. a RESTful API at the beginning)
  - Building a professional component tree
  - Working out professional state management.
  
  We want to learn all this and we want to have the biggest fun possible doing it.

- **For the users:** Our project wants to make travellers and interested people even more excited about the places they don't want to miss out in their life.
